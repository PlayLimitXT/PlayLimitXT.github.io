- Adopted a modern cyber-neon minimalist style, featuring rich and refined visuals and animations, extensive use of glassmorphism, glowing effects, and smooth transitions.
- Implemented a modern content layout using CSS Grid and enriched the content itself.
- Achieved fully responsive design with multi-device support.
- Delivered a visually striking, fresh, and elegant aesthetic.
